# Java-and-MySQL-Database-Connectivity

In this project, I connect MySQL Database and java in eclipse  by following the below 7 seven steps:
* 1) import the package: java.sql.*;
* 2) Load and register the driver: mysql connector and com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
* 3) Establish the connection by extentiating the interface Connection
* 4) Create the statement (in case of fetching data from database)or preparedstatement(in case of inserting data in the database)
* 5) Excute the query

* 7) close

Data are inserted in the database table and data are fetched from the database data
